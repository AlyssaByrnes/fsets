The FSets / FMaps library of finite sets / finite maps has been almost
entirely moved to Coq standard library. The parts that remain here are 
mostly of historical or development interest: 

- FSetRBT.v: implementation of sets based on red-black trees. Still 
 in its original form. It would probably be worth an inclusion in 
 Coq standard library, except that its compilation time in coq could 
 be improved. 

- FSetAVL_dep.v: the original version of AVL sets by J-C Filliatre. 
 Kept mainly for comparison with the newer versions. 

- FSetAVL_z.v / FMapAVL_z.v: newer version of AVL, in direct style 
 instead of dependent, and with romega instead of omega. The only
 difference with the files included in Coq standard library is the 
 use of Z for coding the height of trees, instead of an axiomatic 
 int. 

- extract.v: an extraction test

- compute.v: an test of coq internal computation

- demo.v: a demo 

- PrecedenceGraph: a problem about graphs, using FSet.

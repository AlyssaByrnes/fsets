Title: A Result about Precedence Graphs.

Description: 
  This contribution contains the proof of a small result 
  concerning Precedence Graphs: we have 
                     E<=N^2/4 
  where E is the edges number, and N the node number of a
  Precedence Graph. 
  This contribution is based on the Coq new FSet library of 
  finite sets, and need its compilation first. 
Keywords: Graph, Precedence, Finite, Set
